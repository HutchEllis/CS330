# How do I approach designing software?
<br/>
I learned many new skills throughout this course. I learned how to create shapes, position shapes, apply textures to shapes, and how to apply lighting. The course work was set up to add a new feature to the project each week so the design process was easy to follow and keep up with. The tactics from the design process I could apply in future work is working on projects in a progressive manner and taking care of tasks as needed.

# How do I approach developing programs?
<br/>
The main development strategy I used within this course is trial and error. Getting the shapes in the correct position takes time and a lot of tweaking to the postions of the X,Y, and Z coordinates. Durting thedevelopment process, I found the easiest thing to do was to apply different colors to identical shapes to make movement easier to follow. This was the first course where I had to work on and submit milestones each week throughout the course. This gave me a new perspective and approach to development and I found it easier to keep up with and complete the project.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
<br/>
This course provided me with educational and professional by providing me with the ability to better adapt my schedule around my work. I heard from several people that this course was the most time consuming CS course at SNHU so I was prepared and began working on the class a week before it began. This class also gave me enhanced problem-solving skills by requiring me to figure out solution on how to apply the various required features to my final project model.
